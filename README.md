# hello-world
Mandatory "hello-world" Repository

My name is Bo and I've been afforded the opportunity to call myself an IT Specialist. I truly don't think I deserve the title and have the sketchy skill set to prove it. Truthfully, I'm just a guy who's been incredibly lucky. I've somehow managed to fall into a position that requires more responsibility that I'm ready to handle. Most days, I silently pray things don't fall apart and reveal just how little I know. 
I like PowerShell and would really like to get proficient at it. Without a programmer's backgound, it doesn't seem to come easy for me. Still, I "soldier on" hoping one day the "light bulb" goes off and I ultimately find myself working with Jeffrey Snover or Mark Russinovich. I've read Don Jones' "PowerShell in a Month of Lunches," numerous times and still struggle with bits and pieces of it...perhaps I need to take longer lunches. 
I think Azure is incredible and have enjoyed spinning up VMs with .json templates and adding storage in minutes. Seeing the Boydton Data Center was an incredible experience and gave me even more appreciation for Microsoft. It really is an incredible company.
I know a little about Azure Backup/DPM and actually enjoy working with backups. I've been exposed to how Digital Signage works and a little about Key Management Systems.
At the end of the day, I hope to make my management, my co-workers, and my family proud. I really do want to do the right thing in all aspects of my life.
When I'm not staring at computer screens, you'll find me listening to music with what little hearing remains, playing guitar, knocking around the house, or playing with the kids.
